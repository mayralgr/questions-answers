# How does spring @Autowired annotation works in a REST API? 

The `@Autowired` annotation marks a constructor, setter method, or config method as to be autowired or linked by springâ€™s dependency injection. 

In a `REST API`, the `@Autowired` annotation allows that once the classes annotated with `@Controller ,@Service ,@repository o @RestController, etc.,` are created in runtime, it makes the links between them. 

For example:  

If we have 

A @Repositoty called ShopRepository 

```Java
@Repository
public class ShopRepository {
  public List<Item> searchAll() {
      ...
  }

  ...
  
}
```
 
If we want to use it in a service we use the @Autowired  to do this link 

```Java
@RestController  

public class ShopRestService {  

    @Autowired  
    ShopRepository repository; 
    ...

} 
```

With this, it is avoided to use the 
```Java
    repository = new ShopRepository()
````
as spring finds the dependency, inject it and make an instance.
